## Revealing Module Pattern
This pattern is the same concept as the module pattern in that it focuses on public & private methods.
It was engineered as a way to ensure that all methods and variables are kept private until they are explicitly exposed; usually through an object literal returned by the closure from which itâ€™s defined.
